# Introduction

A simple tool to capture and pin regions of screen for mac OS.

Default hot key is `cmd+shift+A`

# Acknowledge

- Highly inspired by [Snip](https://github.com/isee15/Capture-Screen-For-Multi-Screens-On-Mac).

- Intergrate [HotKey](https://github.com/soffes/HotKey) with Swift Package Manager

# TODO

- Support multi-screen environment.
- Add basic tools for editing pinned views.
