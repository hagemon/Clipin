My development blog can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/hagemon/Clipin-Mac-OS-38d9044334b04882a81561b949b304e6) (Chinese version) with Notion.

Have not been tested on multi-screen environment because I can't afford an extra screen right nowðŸ˜¢.

# Usage

Default hot key is `cmd+shift+A`

# Acknowledge

- Highly inspired by [Snip](https://github.com/isee15/Capture-Screen-For-Multi-Screens-On-Mac).

- Intergrate [HotKey](https://github.com/soffes/HotKey) with Swift Package Manager

# TODO

- Support multi-screen environment.
- Add basic tools for editing pinned view.
